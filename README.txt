Course project
Build a library of simulators and analyses for the models of computation
discussed in lecture (and in the textbook.) This library will constitute a
set of constructive proofs of the theorems discussed in the course.

Decided to write code using C++

9/8
Task 1
Decide on a data type to represent alphabets and characters.
  Plan to use Vectors for alphabets data structure.
  Plan to use string for character data type.

9/10
  Implemented alphabet and character classes
  Started Nth string generator

9/11
  Changed programming language to python. Wanted to try new language.

9/14
  Task 1-2 complete.
  Working on task 3. Write a function that generates the Nth string of a given alphabetâ€™s lexicographic order.

9/15
  Task 3 complete
  Created DFA class

9/16
  Created task 4,5,6
  Task 4 complete
  5,6 in the works... Testing

9/17
  Task 5,6 complete

9/18
  Started Task 7

9/22
  rewrote Task 5,6,7

9/23
  Task 8/9 Completed
9/23
  Task 1 - 10 Complete
  After watching lecture may have to rewrite some code

10/18
  Finished Task #11

10/18
  Rewrote DFA transition functions
  Starting task 12. (Maybe a search algo like breadth-first?)

10/21
  Task 12 Done kind of. Works for my DFAs not sure if it will work for all DFA
